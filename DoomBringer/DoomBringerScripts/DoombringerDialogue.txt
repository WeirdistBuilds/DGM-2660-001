DOOMBRINGER

FADE IN:
The camera opens on forward close up shot of tall, green, uneven grass.
Weed trimmer zooms by, grass is swiftly cut from left to right,
revealing title written in playful font.

EXT. MODERN LANDSCAPING - DAY
TONY, in shorts, visibility vest, and baseball cap, is walking.
He is using a weed trimmer and listening to headphones.
Muffled music and the weedeater engine is heard.

He comes across a halloween mask on the grass. He looks around.



EXT. CLOSE UP OF LAWN
A fluffy white dandelion PRINCESS BLOSSOM is shown.
It has the posture and movements of a young girl,
and speaks with a high-pitched murmur.
All voices are presumed to be coming from TONY.

BLOSSOM
The doombringer is coming! Oh noooooo!

BLOSSOM leans over, the shot follows, revealing a half-open yellow dandelion KING BLOOM.
BLOOM's head is designed to look like he's wearing a crown.
BLOOM speaks in lower, old man murmurs.

BLOSSOM
Whatever shall we doooooo?
BLOOM
Worry not my little Blossom, our knights shall return to save us. There's one now!

The camera pans quickly to the side to reveal the triumphant KNIGHT THISTLE.
Music accompanies this reveal.
THISTLE murmurs with a hardy, gallant tone.

THISTLE
Behold Thistle's gallant return!

The camera cuts back to BLOSSOM and BLOOM.
THISTLE leans into the shot, his leaves act as hands, taking BLOSSOMS into his own.
BLOOM looks on.

THISTLE
Worry not, my love, no evil can resist my small thorns!
BLOSSOM
Sigh!

Thistle catches her

THISTLE
Oh! Your head is so light!
BLOOM
With the power of tiny stabs, our safety is assured!

Lighting strikes and the skies darken. Wind begins to blow.
The camera spins around our characters to reveal TONY, towering over them, wearing the halloween mask.
He brandishes the weed trimmer high over his head.

TONY
(Bellowing, evil laughter, muffled by the mask)

Lightning strikes again, lighting up the evil TONY against a purple sky.
The camera cuts back to our heroes.
BLOOM and BLOSSOM cringe away as THISTLE leans into action.

THISTLE
Fiend! Prepare to be multipley PRRRICKED! Ah! Hah! Yah!

THISTLE assumes a combative stance, and swings his spikiest hand back and forth like a sword.
This acheieves nothing, as TONY is gigantic and much too far away to hit.

TONY
(Malicious laughter, muffled by the mask)

TONY begins to lower the weed trimmer toward the camera.
THISTLE is being affected by heavy, whipping winds. He stands fast.

THISTLE
I shall not let my height and/or distance from my enemy deter me, villain!

The camera shows TONY lowering the weed trimmer further until its whirring head fills the shot.
BLOOM and BLOSSOM cower with fear as they're peppered with chunks of THISTLE.

BLOOM and BLOSSOM
Oh noooo!

These happen at the same time, despite TONY doing both voices.

BLOOM
Our lineage must continue! Go! I'll hold the creature off!

The camera lowers to show both of their bodies are attached to the dirt.
The camrea pans back up, they realize their doom, and embrace each other.

TONY
(Crazy, manic laughter, now less muffled by the mask. The mask seems to mimic the emotion)

TONY begins to lower the weed trimmer toward the camera once more.
The camera shows the spinning shadow closing in on the heads of BLOOM and BLOSSOM.

BOSS
Hey!

EXT. MODERN LANDSCAPING - DAY
The effects have stopped, and the music is muffled, coming from TONY's headphones.
Before TONY can decimate the royal family, he pauses and looks up.
BOSS is standing there, watching, horrified.
TONY quickly removes the mask and sheepishly smiles.
BLOOM and BLOSSOM are now just normal weeds, which TONY quickly snips with the weed trimmer.
